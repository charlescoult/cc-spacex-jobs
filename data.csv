   RESPONSIBILITIES:
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  As a SpaceX recruiter, you will run a full desk with a variety of duties and responsibilities focused on the sourcing, screening, interviewing, and onboarding of top talent candidates to fill mission critical positions (pun intended). In many cases, you are candidates’ first encounter with SpaceX and it is your job to represent the company with professionalism, pride, and enthusiasm. We work in teams and focus on collaboration yet require a high degree of autonomy. So while you are not expected to simply go it alone, you are expected to show initiative, take responsibility, and run with tasks to completion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your day-to-day routine will change often as hiring priorities shift, but there is a basic set of activities you can expect to run with daily, including, but not limited to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Meet with your client groups to discuss headcount, new requisitions, hiring strategy, and/or interview feedback – you truly act as a partner to your clients and not merely as an order taker
  </li>
  <li>
   Screen candidates who apply to requisitions – as the SpaceX name brand grows, our job postings continue to fill up with stellar candidates
  </li>
  <li>
   Source candidates – often the best candidates are the ones not actively looking
  </li>
  <li>
   Discuss candidates you have screened with your client groups and recommend top candidates for interviews
  </li>
  <li>
   Give tours to candidates before their onsite interview – this is a chance to showcase all the exciting things going on at SpaceX
  </li>
  <li>
   Attend interviews alongside your client groups to act as another set of eyes and ears in evaluating candidates
  </li>
  <li>
   Once candidates are approved for hire, you will begin the HR onboarding process including initiating background checks, completing reference checks, negotiating offer packages including extending offer letters, and issuing new hire paperwork – you’ll have plenty of support from the HR, benefits, and compensation departments to make this process as seamless as possible
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Some days you will have multiple candidates coming onsite for interviews and you will spend that time giving tours and coordinating the candidate experience. Other days, you will need to fill your candidate pipeline and will spend the majority of the day screening/sourcing candidates. No day is the same here and the pace moves fast, but ultimately your job is to effectively attract, organize, and manage the flow of the country’s most talented individuals to help advance the mission to Mars!

The Build Engineer role covers design for manufacturability concepts through integration and testing of the full tower. You will be highly engaged on the primary and secondary structures of the tower, including designing tooling (assembly aides, welding, part fixturing, etc.) and processes (welding, large part movement, large structure integration) to rapidly build early versions of the tower. Further along in the build this you will be responsible for items such as integration operations sequencing and working with technicians on installing flight-critical hardware on the tower. Throughout the build, you will be responsible for documenting processes and driving continual improvement to them for future builds. Furthermore, Build Engineers will be expected to sometimes act as de-facto supervisors and advisors to production technicians, welders, and other skilled labor partners.
