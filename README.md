# SpaceX Job Scraper

I created this scraper to pull all jobs from SpaceX's Careers page and make a CSV file for them that can be imported into Google Sheets. This allows me to more easily sort through the job postings and make a list of the ones I'd like to apply for.

Initially, I wanted to pull the "Requirements" sections of all the job postings from their corresponding greenhouse.io page so that I could filter out the jobs that I don't meet the requirements for however the pages are not formatted consistently, making the job a bit more difficult. I don't have the time to add that feature right now. I may revisit this in the future.
